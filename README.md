# Custom Bifurcator Video Player by Epic Coders Team

## Introduction
The Custom Bifurcator Video Player is a cutting-edge tool designed to amplify the learning experience at Crio.do. This innovative software enables users to efficiently manage and optimize recorded live lectures, transforming them into a more immersive and engaging learning resource for students.

## Problem Statement
The challenge presented to us was clear: we needed to create a system capable of automating the process of video bifurcation.

## Approach
Our systematic approach to solving this problem involved three main steps:
1. Obtaining the session videos.
2. Gathering the associated session materials, such as PowerPoint presentations.
3. Extracting the necessary data based on specified requirements.

## Methodology
The success of our methodology was largely dependent on the information extracted from the videos. To better understand our approach, it's essential to know how teaching is conducted at Crio. Typically, at the beginning of a session, mentors wait for attendees to join. Once the audience is ready, the lesson begins, usually following a structure provided by the PowerPoint presentations supplied by Crio. When a new topic or section starts, it's standard practice to present the relevant slides to the users.

To optimize this process using our Bifurcator, we:
1. Created an SRT (SubRip Subtitle) file based on the video's audio.
2. Developed an API to harness the data from the SRT file.
3. Displayed the extracted data via a user-friendly interface, ensuring that students can easily interact with and benefit from the bifurcated content.

## Challenges
Throughout our journey, we faced several challenges:
- Designing and implementing a custom video player capable of displaying the bifurcated video.
- Identifying and marking chapters within the video content based on the timestamps was more complex than anticipated.

## Learnings
This project proved to be both demanding and enlightening. Our team faced numerous challenges, but the lessons we drew from this hackathon were invaluable. Not only did we acquire technical knowledge, but we also honed our problem-solving and collaboration skills.
